# Text Formatter
Text Formatter will transform your sentence in various ways.

## Description
This mini-app is my **first project** here on gitHub in my coding journey, and has been made in order to get familiarity with basic JS concepts. In this app you can write your sentence, and and it will modify it for you by simply clicking a button.

## Functionalities
With Text Formatter, you can transform your sentence in various ways: you can make it all lowercase or all uppercase. You can also capitalise only the first letter of every word, or even only the first letter of every different sentence.

## Technologies
The core structure of Text Formatter is written with **HTML**, the style is added with **CSS**, and the functionalities are handled with **JavaScript**.

## Getting started
Coming soon!

## Project status
This project is a **learning exercise**, and therefore it will probably have flaws. This is also my first attempt at building something with JavaScript, so other different projects will follow.

## What I learned
While working with Text Formatter, I've had the occasion to gain confidence with various JS features, including **arrays**, **functions**, **loops** and **objects**. It was also a great opportunity to work to make the code as clean as possible.
I also got better (hopefully!) at creating responsive design in CSS, utilizing **media queries**.
